# API Doc Generator
A backbone web app that builds a human readable version of JSON documentation dynamically created by a company's framework.
This was part of a small exercise that was given to me. You can check out the result [here](http://pedrocatre.github.io/API-Doc-Generator/).

It presents a list of resources that you can expand to view the operations/interfaces. You can also expand the operations one at a time or use the controls over the resource to list all operations or expand all operations.

Also when you click to view a resource and/or interface the URL updates so you can bookmark a specific position. For example you can have a [link to the Customers resource](http://pedrocatre.github.io/API-Doc-Generator/#resource/Customers)  or a link to [the Products' update_product interface](http://pedrocatre.github.io/API-Doc-Generator/#resource/Products/operation/Products.update_product).

The design is heavily based on [swagger](http://swagger.io/) :)
